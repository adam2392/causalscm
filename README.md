# Causal Inference: Structural Causal Modeling

causalscm is a Python library for working with causal models.

# Why?

Representation of causal inference models in Python are severely lacking. Moreover, sampling from causal models is non-trivial. However, sampling from simulations is a requirement to benchmark different structural learning, causal ID, or other causal related algorithms.

This package aims at serving as a framework for representing causal models and sampling from causal models.

``causalscm`` interfaces with other popular Python packages, such as ``pgmpy`` and ``networkx`` for graphical representations.
